# Anki-HTML-CSS-Cards


## Anki HTML & CSS Cards for VSCode

This is a card pack I created for myself to utilize Anki's SRS (Spaced Repetition System) method of memorisation. Inside you will find 
[HTML & CSS](https://github.com/rayanthoney/Anki-HTML-CSS-Cards/blob/main/HTML%20&%20CSS.md) cards with questions of the **HTML  Elements, which are created using tags.**. _\(will be adding more as time permits\)_

## Requirements
